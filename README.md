> An Enterprise Mirco-Frontends Framework

- üì¶ Based On [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa)
- üì± Technology Agnostic
- üí™ HTML Entry Access Mode
- üõ° Style Isolation
- üß≥ JS Sandbox
- ‚ö° Prefetch Assets
- üîå [Umi Plugin](https://github.com/umijs/plugins/tree/master/packages/plugin-qiankun) Integration

In Chinese traditional culture `qian` means heaven and `kun` stands for earth, so `qiankun` is the universe.

## ü§î Motivation

As we know what micro-frontends aims for:

> Techniques, strategies and recipes for building a **modern web app** with **multiple teams** using **different JavaScript frameworks**. ‚Äî [Micro Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/)

Modularity is very important for large application. By breaking down a large system into individual sub-applications, we can achieve good divide-and-conquer between products and when necessary combination, especially for enterprise applications that usually involve multi-team collaboration. But if you're trying to implement such a micro frontends architecture system by yourself, you're likely to run into some tricky problems:

- In what form do sub applications publish static resources?
- How does the main application integrate individual sub-applications?
- How do you ensure that sub-applications are independent of each other (development independent, deployment independent) and runtime isolated?
- Performance issues? What about public dependencies?
- And so on...

After solving these common problems of micro frontends, we extracted the kernel of our solution after a lot of internal online application testing and polishing, and then named it `qiankun`.

**Probably the most complete micro-frontends solution you ever metüßê.**
